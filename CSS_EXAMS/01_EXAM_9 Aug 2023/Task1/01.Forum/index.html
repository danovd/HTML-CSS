                        Stay away from those people who try to disparage your ambitions. Small minds will always do that, but great minds will give you a feeling that you can become great too.

It is the fuel that allows common people to attain uncommon results. Individual commitment to a group effortâ€”that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilisation work.</p>
